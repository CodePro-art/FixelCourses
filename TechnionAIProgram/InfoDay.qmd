## Projects

 - There are 2 projects:
   - Classic Machine Learning.
   - Deep Learning (Computer Vision / LLM).
 - The projects should be about _real world problem_.
 - The projects should imitata, in a _small time scale_, a project in the industry.
 - Projects in doubles / triplets.

## Pre

## The Learning Material

 - _Self Contained_ slides.
 - Exercises in class based on _Jupyter Notebooks_.
 - Home exercises based on _Jupyter Notebooks_.
 - Learning Session / Exercise Session.

# Prerequisites

## What Is Different?

 - The people.
 - The background alignment.
 - The scale.
