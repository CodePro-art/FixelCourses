# Building The AI Program

## Building the AI Program

:::{.incremental}
 * {{< iconify pajamas issue-type-objective >}} Setting the _objective_ - Capable _real world_ AI practitioners.
 * {{< iconify fluent people-audience-20-filled >}} Defining the target _audience_.  
 * {{< iconify game-icons team-idea >}} Building the tutoring _team_.
 * {{< iconify clarity list-solid >}} Building the _syllabus_.
:::

. . . 

:::{.callout-tip title="The Initiative"}

The AI Program was initiative by the industry, asking for a program to counter the shortage in highly capable AI practitioners.

## Projects

 - There are 2 projects:
   - Classic Machine Learning.
   - Deep Learning (Computer Vision / LLM).
 - The projects should be about _real world problem_.
 - The projects should imitate, in a _small time scale_, a project in the industry.
 - During the time dedicated for projects the tutors will be available for guidance.
 - The task can be either initiative of the team or proposed by the tutors.
 - Projects in doubles / triplets.

. . . 

:::{.callout-note title="The Objective"}

## The Learning Material

 - _Self Contained_ slides.
 - Exercises in class based on _Jupyter Notebooks_.
 - Home exercises based on _Jupyter Notebooks_.
 - Learning Session / Exercise Session.

## Prerequisites

:::{.incremental}
 * {{< iconify ic twotone-science >}} Some _science_ or a like background.
 * {{< iconify solar programming-bold >}} Some knowledge in _programming_ (Python is recommended).

# Why the Technion AI Program?

## The Background Mini Courses

:::{.incremental}
 * {{< iconify arcticons deepstash >}} We want to go deeper in the understanding level.
 * {{< iconify arcticons algorithms >}} We want to understand the algorithms.  
 * {{< iconify clarity language-solid >}} We need a language for that: Programming & Mathematics.
 * {{< iconify carbon scis-transparent-supply >}} No shortcuts, we'll supply it.
 * {{< iconify arcticons best-connect >}} It will make the class homogenous in its capabilities.
:::

. . .

:::{.callout-note title="Intuition"}

The deeper understanding is the source of intuition and problem solving capabilities.

:::

## What Is Different?

:::{.incremental}
 * {{< iconify ph student-fill >}} The students.
 * {{< iconify game-icons flag-objective >}} The objective  
 * {{< iconify codicon symbol-method >}} The method.
 * {{< iconify ic sharp-scale >}} The scale.
:::

. . .


:::{.callout-important title="Why?"}

 - We start high.
 - We aim higher.
